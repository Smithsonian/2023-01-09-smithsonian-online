## Thank You!

Thank you all for your hard work!

Big thanks to our instructors, helpers, and workshop organizer!

## Workshop Recap

**Day 1 -- Unix Shell**

-   the Unix shell is powerful because it has many small commands that can be combined in infinite ways using redirection ("\|" and "\>")
-   we had a chance to talk about 'wc', 'sort', and 'grep', but 'cut' (for isolating columns), 'uniq' (for finding unique lines in a file), and 'comm' (for finding lines common or different between two files) are three other commands that combine well with them and that I use frequently

## Workshop Recap

**Day 1 -- Unix Shell continued**

-   the shell will only ever do the commands you give it exactly as you give them so be careful especially when deleting things and creating files!
-   grep is a great tool for finding information based on a keyword search - using regular expressions in your search term makes it even more powerful and flexible

## Helpful Shell Links

-   <https://explainshell.com/> will dissect any shell command you give it and display help for each piece
-   <https://tldr.sh/> is a great manual tool with short descriptions of shell commands as well as many of the options for them. Also links to more information on each one.
-   <https://www.shellcheck.net/> will check for any common errors in shell commands that you type in or upload

## Workshop Recap

**Day 2 -- Regular Expressions**

-   Learned about regular expressions (or regex) for pattern matching
-   Identified potential use cases for regex within the libraries
-   Worked with common regex metacharacters to find and match strings

## Helpful Regex Links

-   Online regex tool: <https://regex101.com/>
-   Exercises for practicing:
    -   <https://librarycarpentry.org/lc-data-intro/03-quiz/index.html>
    -   <https://librarycarpentry.org/lc-data-intro/04-exercises/index.html>
-   [HPC Regular Expressions tutorial](https://github.com/SmithsonianWorkshops/HydraResources/blob/master/Regular_Expressions.md)

## Workshop Recap

**Day 2 -- OpenRefine**

-   Use OpenRefine to analyze and edit your 'messy' tabular data easily in a handy GUI
-   Remember you are working locally and not editing your original file, so export out your finished data to a new file.

## Helpful OpenRefine Links

-   Community Carpentries Chat last month with Adam Gray from HSFA using OpenRefine to wrangle data sets between ArchivesSpace, DAMS, and CDIS. ([Recording](https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/02409be7-32b6-4e05-ad1b-7418c486de49))
-   Check out the [Data Carpentry OpenRefine lesson](https://datacarpentry.org/OpenRefine-ecology-lesson/) too.

## Workshop Recap

**Day 3 -- GitHub**

-   GitHub is a tool for version control of code and documents that also allows for extensive collaboration.

## Helpful GitHub Links

-   Smithsonian specifics for GitHub: [link](https://miketrizna.github.io/github-without-command-line/smithsonian.html)
-   Check out the episode on hosting websites on GitHub that we didn't get to: [link](https://miketrizna.github.io/github-without-command-line/websites.html)
